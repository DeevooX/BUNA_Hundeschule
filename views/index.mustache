            <p class="about-description">My name is Natascha, and I am a trained medical assistant. In 2023, I completed my training as a dog trainer. For me, it was clear early on that I could not imagine a life without dogs. After getting my current dog, "Butch," I realized that I wanted to learn more about canine behavior to understand and support my pet in the best way possible. Now, I enjoy passing on my knowledge to help other dog owners build strong bonds with their loyal companions.</p>
